This package contains a plug-in that allows the Scribe Character Editor to
work with characters from the Forgotten Realms campaign setting from Wizards of
the Coast.  To install it, copy Realms.js into your Scribe installation
directory, then add 'Realms.js' to the CUSTOMIZATION_URLS array in your
installation's scribe.html.  If you also want to use the Forgotten Realms
prestige classes, copy RealmsPrestige.js into your Scribe installation
directory and add 'RealmsPrestige.js' to the CUSTOMIZATION_URLS array.
