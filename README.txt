<h2>Forgotton Realms Scribe Module Notes</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>
This package contains a plug-in that allows the Scribe Character Editor to
work with characters from the Forgotten Realms campaign setting from Wizards of
the Coast.  To install it, copy Realms.js and Realmsdoc.html into your Scribe
installation directory and add 'Realms.js' to the CUSTOMIZATION_URLS array in
your installation's scribe.html.  If you also want to use the Forgotten Realms
prestige classes, copy RealmsPrestige.js into your Scribe installation
directory and add 'RealmsPrestige.js' to the CUSTOMIZATION_URLS array.

<h3>Usage Notes</h3>

    Enlarge Spell" to distinguish it from the feat of the same name.

    Harper Scout's "Harper Knowledge" feature is renamed "Bardic Knowledge",
    since the two are identical and stack.
